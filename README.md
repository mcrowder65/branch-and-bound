# branch-and-bound

This is a project created for my CS 312 class at Brigham Young University.<br>

The algorithm used is known as branch and bound, which was used to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem"> Travelling salesman problem</a><br>

The code is written in C#, I used Microsoft Visual Studio as my IDE..<br>
